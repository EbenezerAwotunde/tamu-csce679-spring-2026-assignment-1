# CSCE 679 Data Visualization Assignment 1

In this task, you need to draw a **Matrix View** to visualize the **Monthly Temperature** of Hong Kong, where the color of each matrix cell encodes the temperature. You can find the data in [temperature_daily.csv](./temperature_daily.csv). You only need to focus on the last 10 years of data.

Here are the basic requirements:

1. In the matrix, the x direction indicates the year, and the y direction indicates the month. Each cell indicates the corresponding month of a specific year.

1. You need to visualize the maximum and minimum temperatures by month using the background color of each cell. Please use a mouse click to switch between the maximum and minimum temperatures.

1. When hovering the mouse on each cell, a tip should appear to show the date and the temperature value.

1. Add a mini line chart to each cell to show daily temperature changes. The x-axis represents the days in a month, and the y-axis represents the temperature.

1. A legend is needed to show the mapping between colors and values.

  An example is like this:
